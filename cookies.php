                        A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables Konnect.one features and functionality. For example, cookies enable us to identify your device, secure your access to Konnect.one and
                        our sites generally, and even help us know if someone attempts to access your account from a different device. Cookies also enable you to easily share content on Konnect.one and help us serve
                        relevant ads to you.

                        We use cookies on our sites and mobile applications. Any browser visiting these sites will receive cookies from us. We also place cookies in your
                        browser when you visit non-Konnect.one sites that host our plugins or tags.

                        We use two types: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to our site or interact with our services
                        without signing in again. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

                        Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit Konnect.one, remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience that’s in line with your settings. Cookies also make your
                        interactions with us faster and more secure. Additionally, cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the sites, and bring customized features to you through Konnect.one
                        plugins such as our “Share” button.
