                        Konnect respects the intellectual property rights of others and desires to offer a platform which contains no content that violates
                        those rights. Our User Agreement requires that information posted by Members be accurate, lawful and not in violation of the rights of
                        third parties. To promote these objectives, Konnect provides a process for submission of complaints concerning content posted by our Members.
                        Our policy and procedures are described and/or referenced in the sections that follow.
                        <br><br>
                        Please note that whether or not we disable access to or remove content, Konnect may make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification,
                        including the complainant’s contact information, to the Member who posted the content and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the Member that
                        Konnect has received notice of an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or other content violation. It is also our policy, in appropriate
                        circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of Members, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly
                        infringe the rights of others or otherwise post unlawful content.
                        <br><br>
                        Please note that any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury. A false notice or counter-notice
                        may give rise to personal liability. You may therefore want to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or a counter-notice..
